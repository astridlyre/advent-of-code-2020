# Advent of code solutions

My attempts at JavaScript (and so to be Go) solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) puzzles.
As someone in their first year (less than six months!) of learning to code, I am finding these puzzles quite challenging.
The first few days are a bit unorganized as I had not yet decided to store my answers on GitHub. Day 8 and onwards are more
nicely formatted.
